-Laboratory project. Study battery loss curves and predict whether aging. Based on battery aging data. 

-Using Tensor-flow tools and design RNN-LSTM neural network model.

-The initial data is from NASA laboratory data. Using battery aging data to train the model.

-Finished model and get more than 95% accuracy. Complete project review.
